<p>As applications get bigger the code gets more complex. The simple application structure used here does not scale well to large applications. However, some small adjustments can make life much better.</p>
<ul>
<li>Convert the <code>data</code> structure into a <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/comparing-handle-and-value-classes.html" rel="nofollow"><code>handle</code></a> object. This allows a single <code>data</code> object to be shared between multiple graphical components, and in turn means that the interface need not be built as a single monolithic entity.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/events-sending-and-responding-to-messages.html" rel="nofollow">events system</a> to trigger updates to specific parts of the app in response to properties of the data object changing. This removes the need for a single large <code>updateInterface</code> function and reduces coupling between parts of the interface. For example, the <code>SelectedExample</code> property would have an associated event such that when it is changed by a callback (or from the command line) it notifies other interface components of the change. Each interface component (or group thereof) can listen for the events that affect it.</li>
</ul>
